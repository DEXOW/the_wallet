## About
The wallet is a mobile application that serves as a digital wallet which can store user identity information such as NIC, Access Pass, NFC Keys, Payment Cards, etc. This app is designed and developed as a solution to various problems and frustrations faced when using a physical card. This application includes the use of a frontend mobile application for Android / IOS, a backend cloud based server and databse to process certain data requests and store user account details. Once a user scans a card, it wil be stored locally in the device in digital format in order to preserve data confidentiallity. The frontend of the application is developed using the Flutter framework, which allows the development of multi-platform applications.
